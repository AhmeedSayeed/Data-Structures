# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms as part of my coursework in Data Structures. All code is implemented from scratch using modern OOP concepts, with a focus on understanding internal mechanisms rather than relying solely on STL components.

## ✨ Features

- All data structures are implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Heap implementation is **generalized** to support both **MaxHeap** and **MinHeap**
- **Randomized QuickSort** to optimize worst-case performance
- Modular code that’s easy to read and expand

## 📦 Contents

### 📊 Sorting Algorithms
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Shell Sort
- **Quick Sort** (with randomized pivot for worst-case optimization)
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort

---

### 🔗 Linked Lists
- Unordered Linked List
- Ordered Linked List
- Ordered Doubly Linked List

---

### 📚 Stacks
- Stack using Array
- Stack using Singly Linked List

---

### ⏳ Queues
- Queue using Circular Array
- Queue using Linked List
- **Priority Queue** implemented using Heap

---

### 🌳 Trees
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with all basic operations

---

### 🛠️ Heaps
- Fully generalized Heap
- Supports both **Max Heap** and **Min Heap**
- Implemented with templated and modular design

---

## 🎓 Purpose

This project serves as a learning exercise during my study of Data Structures (Spring 2025). It’s intended for educational purposes and to help others understand the internal logic of classic data structures and algorithms.
